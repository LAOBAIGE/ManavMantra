Copyright 2017 The MathWorks, Inc. Modified from Natural Earth datasets as described below. 

Modifications:
* At 8 distinct zoom levels (0 to 7), an image was constructed by projecting vector polygons from Natural Earth to Web Mercator    
* The image for each zoom level was colored with two colors, one for land and one for water, and divided into tiles of uniform size
* Specific vector boundary overlays from Natural Earth shapefiles are embedded in the tiled dataset at zoom levels 1 to 7
