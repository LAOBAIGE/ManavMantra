%CLONE Create System object with same property values
%   C = clone(OBJ) creates another instance of the System object, OBJ, with
%   the same property values. If OBJ is locked, the clone method creates a
%   copy that is also locked and has states initialized to the same values
%   as the original. If OBJ is not locked, the clone method creates a new
%   unlocked object with uninitialized states.
