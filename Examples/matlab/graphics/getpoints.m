%GETPOINTS Return points that define animated line
%   [x,y] = GETPOINTS(an)  returns the x and y coordinates for the points
%   that define the animated line specified by an. Create an animated line
%   with the animatedline function.
%
%   [x,y,z] = GETPOINTS(an) returns the coordinates for the 3-D animated
%   line specified by an. If the line does not have any z values, then
%   getpoints returns z as a vector of zeros the same length as x and y.
