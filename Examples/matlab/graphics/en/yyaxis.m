%YYAXIS Create chart with two y-axes
%   YYAXIS LEFT creates an axes that has a y-axis on both the left and right
%   sides. Or, if an axes already exists, then this command activates the side
%   associated with the left y-axis. Subsequent graphics commands target the
%   active side. If the current axes does not have two y-axes, then this 
%   command adds a second y-axis.
%
%   YYAXIS RIGHT activates the side associated with the right y-axis. If the
%   current axes does not have two y-axes, then this command adds a second
%   y-axis. If an axes does not exist, then this command first creates one.
%
%   YYAXIS(AX,...) specifies the active side for the axes ax instead of the
%   current axes. Use single quotes around input arguments that are character
%   strings, for example, yyaxis(ax,'right') and yyaxis(ax,'left').
