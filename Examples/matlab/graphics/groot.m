%GROOT Get the graphics root object
%   h = GROOT returns the graphics root object
%
%   The root object is the root of the graphics object tree. The root
%   contains all the figures that exist. Root properties contain
%   information about the graphics environment and the current state of the
%   graphics system. 
%
%   There is only one root object and you neither create nor delete the
%   root object. MATLAB creates the root when the graphics system is first
%   used.
