%DISP Display array.
%   DISP(X) displays array X without printing the array name or 
%   additional description information such as the size and class name.
%   In all other ways it's the same as leaving the semicolon off an
%   expression except that nothing is shown for empty arrays.
%
%   If X is a string or character array, the text is displayed.
