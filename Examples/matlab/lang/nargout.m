%NARGOUT Number of function output arguments.
%   Inside the body of a user-defined function, NARGOUT returns the
%   number of output arguments that were used to call the function.
%
%   NARGOUT(FUN) returns the number of declared outputs for the
%   function FUN.  The number of arguments is negative if the
%   function has a variable number of output arguments.  FUN can be 
%   a function handle that maps to a specific function, or a character 
%   vector or string scalar that contains the name of that function.
