%XOR Logical EXCLUSIVE OR.
%   XOR(S,T) is the logical symmetric difference of elements S and T. The
%   result is logical 1 (TRUE) where either S or T, but not both, is
%   nonzero. The result is logical 0 (FALSE) where S and T are both zero or
%   nonzero. S and T must have compatible sizes. In the simplest cases,
%   they can be the same size or one can be a scalar. Two inputs have
%   compatible sizes if, for every dimension, the dimension sizes of the
%   inputs are either the same or one of them is 1.
