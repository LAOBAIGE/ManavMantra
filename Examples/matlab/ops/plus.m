%+   Plus.
%   X + Y adds matrices X and Y. X and Y must have compatible sizes. In the
%   simplest cases, they can be the same size or one can be a scalar. Two
%   inputs have compatible sizes if, for every dimension, the dimension
%   sizes of the inputs are either the same or one of them is 1.
%
%   C = PLUS(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A + B' when A or B is an
%   object.
