%./  Right array divide.
%   A./B denotes element-by-element division. X and Y must have compatible
%   sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same size or one can be a
%   scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for every dimension, the
%   dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same or one of them is 1.
%
%   C = RDIVIDE(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A ./ B' when A or B is an
%   object.
