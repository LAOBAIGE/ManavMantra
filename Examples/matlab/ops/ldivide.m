%.\  Left array divide.
%   A.\B denotes element-by-element division. X and Y must have compatible
%   sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same size or one can be a
%   scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for every dimension, the
%   dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same or one of them is 1.
%
%   C = LDIVIDE(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A .\ B' when A or B is an
%   object.
%
%   See also RDIVIDE, MRDIVIDE, MLDIVIDE.
