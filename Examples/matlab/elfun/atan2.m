%ATAN2  Four quadrant inverse tangent.
%   ATAN2(Y,X) is the four quadrant arctangent of the elements of X and Y
%   such that -pi <= ATAN2(Y,X) <= pi. X and Y must have compatible sizes.
%   In the simplest cases, they can be the same size or one can be a
%   scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for every dimension, the
%   dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same or one of them is 1.
