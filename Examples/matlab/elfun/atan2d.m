%ATAN2D  Four quadrant inverse tangent, result in degrees.
%   ATAN2D(Y,X) is the four quadrant arctangent of the elements of X and Y
%   such that -180 <= ATAN2D(Y,X) <= 180. X and Y must have compatible
%   sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same size or one can be a
%   scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for every dimension, the
%   dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same or one of them is 1.
