function y = unshiftdata(x,perm,nshifts)
%   Y = UNSHIFTDATA(X,PERM,NSHIFTS) restores the orientation of the data that
%   was shifted with SHIFTDATA.  PERM is the permutation vector, and NSHIFTS
%   is the number of shifts that were returned from SHIFTDATA.
%   UNSHIFTDATA is meant to be used in tandem with SHIFTDATA.  They are handy
%   for creating functions that work along a certain dimension, like MAX, MIN.
%
%   Examples:
%     x = fi(magic(3))
%     [x,perm,nshifts] = shiftdata(x,2) % Work along 2nd dimension
%     y = unshiftdata(x,perm,nshifts)   % Reshapes back to original
%
%     x = fi(1:5)                        % Originally a row
%     [x,perm,nshifts] = shiftdata(x,[]) % Work along 1st non-singleton dimension
%     y = unshiftdata(x,perm,nshifts)    % Reshapes back to original

if isempty(perm)
