Access the 'ShortcutsForSelectedSystem' property of the converter object to list available shortcuts.","dataInMATLABBlk":"Autoscale is not supported for data used in MATLAB function block.","invalidSFData":"Invalid stateflow data object result.","DSMNotFound":"Target data store memory for ''${0}'' not found.","NamedShortcutDoesNotExist":"Model ${0} does not contain a shortcut named ${1}.","lockedDTFromMask":"Data type in this block is locked from parent mask.","invalidObjectForNamedTypeHandle":"NamedTypeHandle does not exist for the provided object.","mlfbCompatibilityWarning":"Warnings were detected in this variable or the MATLAB function this variable belongs to. ${0} to see details.","invalidDataTypeSpecification":"Invalid data type specification.","autoscaleProposeFail":"Autoscaling proposal failed. Cannot handle certain signals.","topLinkNotMask":"This item can't be autoscaled.  This item is located under a library link, and the link does not provide a mask parameter that maps to the data type specification of this item.","invalidRangeType":"Invalid range type.","sharedGroupWarningPropagation":"This result belongs to DTGroup ${0}. The data types of one or more elements of this group may result in update diagram errors. View the DTGroup by adding the DTGroup column to the spreadsheet.","noSDIRuns":"Unable to compare results. This may be because the system has not yet been simulated, or because no signals in the system are being logged.","multiwordWLMicro":"The word length selection exceeds the size for long specified on the Hardware Implementation pane of the Configuration Parameters dialog box. Multi-word representation is proposed.","evalToEnumDT":"The data type of ''${0}'' resolves to an enumerated data type and cannot be autoscaled.","notValidRange":"The collected range is not valid.

Unfortunately you must quit MATLAB now using \"exit force\".","noRunsExist":"The action cannot be completed because there are no runs in the specified Converter object.","unspecifiedSign":"The data type cannot have an unspecified sign.","BusObjectHandleNotFoundInMap":"Handle for bus Object ''${0}'' was not found.","runSettingsDoNotExist":"There are no settings saved for run ''${0}'', so no settings can be applied.","invalidSpecificWL":"Invalid word length for specific type constraint. Word length should be real, finite and less than 128.","noContainerType":"The Fixed-Point Tool cannot propose a data type for this result because the specified data type is ''${0}''. To get a data type proposal, the specified data type of the result must be either floating-point, fixed-point or use an inheritance rule.","mlfbCompatibilityError":"Errors were detected in this variable or the MATLAB function this variable belongs to. ${0} to see details.","noAutoscaler":"No autoscalers are mapped","configParamNotMatch":"System parameter ''${0}'' is expected to be set to ''${1}'' but remains ''${2}''","_localized":{}}
